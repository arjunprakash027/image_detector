# image_detector
A simple website built using html css and Django backend that uses TensorFlow to detect the item present in the image with a average amount of accuracy

Back-end built with the help of django

I used the already trained resnet50 to predict the answers. No new dataset have been trained by
 me. 
 
 Will train a dataset and implement it in future
